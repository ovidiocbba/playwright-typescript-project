## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

#### 1. Node.js
1. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed (version 14 or higher).
2. Verify the installation by running the following commands in your terminal:
```sh
npm -v
```
#### 2. Git
1. Please download Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads
2. Choose the version for your operating system. 
3. Accept the defaults and follow the screen instructions to install Git.

#### 3. Visual Studio Code
1. Please download Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Choose your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Install the following **extensions** for Visual Studio Code:
   - **Playwright Test for VSCode**  
   *Provides integration with Playwright for running, debugging, and managing tests directly within Visual Studio Code.*
   - **ESLint**  
   *Automatically checks your code for errors and style issues based on your project's ESLint rules, providing instant feedback and quick fixes as you write.*
   - **YAML**  
   *Offers syntax highlighting, validation, and autocompletion for YAML files, which are commonly used for configuration files in CI/CD pipelines.*

### Configuring Environment
#### 1. Clone remote repository
Git
##### Step1 Generate SSH Keys
- Open "Git Bash" (This is installed when you install Git).
- Enter the following command : 
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

##### Step2 Clone the repository
- By git command line :
```sh
git clone git@github.com:ovidiocbba/playwright-typescript-project.git
```
#### 2. Install Dependencies
Install all the required dependencies using npm. This will install Playwright, TypeScript, and other packages defined in the `package.json` file.

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the tests

**IMPORTANT:** Please add the appropriate values for your `.env` file. 
For example: `ENV='test'`

Run all tests in headless mode (without a browser window):
```bash
npx playwright test
```
Run a test case using a tag
```bash
npx playwright test --grep '@TC-0001' --project=chromium --headed
```
View Test Reports
```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

  </tr>

### Run Tests and Generate Allure Reports
1. Run tests with the Allure reporter:
```bash
npx playwright test --reporter=allure-playwright
```
2. Serve the Allure report:
```bash
allure generate ./allure-results -o ./allure-report --clean
```
3. Open Allure Report:
```bash
allure open ./allure-report
```
## Features:
- **Easy Installation & Execution**: Run test cases effortlessly using simple commands. E.g: 
  ```bash
  npm run test:ui:chrome
  ```
- **Capture**: Videos, screenshots, trace and others are captured automatically on test failures.  
  **Steps to view the trace**:
  1. Once the tests finish running, open the generated HTML report. 
  2. **Navigate to the Failed Test**: In the HTML report, youâ€™ll see a list of test results. Look for the test that failed and was retried.  
  3. **Click on the Retry #1 Tab**: This tab will display details specific to the retried run of the test.
  4. **View the Trace**: Once inside the '**Retry #1**' tab, under the "**Traces**" section, you will see an "**Image**" that you need to click on.
  5. **Explore the trace**: Once the trace viewer opens, you can inspect the steps of the test('**Actions**' tab), view screenshots, details('**Metadata**' tab) network activity, and console logs.
- **Environment Management**: Use environment files to easily run tests across different environments. Set in `.env` file. E.g: `ENV='test'`   
    **Enviroments examples**: 
    - test
    - staging
    - production
- **Execute Test Filtering Using Tags**: You can tag tests (e.g., @Regression, @Smoke, @Negative) and selectively execute only the required.   
    **Tags examples**:  
    - @Regression
    - @Smoke
    - @Acceptance
    - @Functional
    - @E2E
    - @Negative
    - @Boundary  
  
  Run tests tagged with a single tag, such as @Regression:
  ```bash
  npx playwright test --grep '@Regression' --project=chromium --headed
  ```
  Run tests tagged with either @Regression or @Smoke:
  ```bash
  npx playwright test --grep '@Regression|@Smoke' --project=chromium --headed
  ```
  Run tests that have both @Regression and @Smoke tags:
  ```bash
  npx playwright test --grep '@Regression' --grep '@Smoke' --project=chromium --headed
  ```
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Implemented for better test structure and maintainability.
- **Logger**: Utilizes the winston library to manage logging during test execution.
- **Headed/Headless Mode**: Supports both headed and headless execution for Firefox and Chrome browsers.
- **Allure Reports**: Automatically generated after test execution for clear reporting.
  ```bash
  npm run test:ui:allure
  ```

## GitHub Actions:
- **Automated Execution**: Tests run automatically on every push to the main branch or when a pull request is created.
- **Scheduled Regression Tests**: Schedule a daily regression test at 22:00 PM and deploy the Allure report.  
  [https://ovidiocbba.github.io/playwright-typescript-project](https://ovidiocbba.github.io/playwright-typescript-project)

- **Manual Execution**: Trigger test cases manually with different parameters.
  [/actions/workflows/execution.yml](https://github.com/ovidiocbba/playwright-typescript-project/actions/workflows/execution.yml)

- **Secure Secrets Management**: Use GitHub Secrets to handle sensitive data securely.  
  **Secrets**: SONAR_TOKEN, UI_PASSWORD, UI_PASSWORD  
- **Composite Action**: Leverage a custom composite action for deploying Allure reports.  
  [/.github/actions/deploy_allure_report/action.yml](https://github.com/ovidiocbba/playwright-typescript-project/blob/main/.github/actions/deploy_allure_report/action.yml)

- **GitHub Action Reporter**: Integration with GitHub Action reporter to display test results directly in GitHub.
- **SonarQube Integration**: Analyze code for vulnerabilities and code smells using SonarQubeCloud integration.

- **Allure Report Deployment**: Automatically deploy Allure reports using GitHub Pages for easy access and sharing.
