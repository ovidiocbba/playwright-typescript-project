# Playwright with TypeScript Project

This project uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for end-to-end testing.

## :clipboard: Features:

- **Easy Installation & Execution**: Run test cases effortlessly using simple commands. E.g:
  ```bash
  npm run test:ui:chrome
  ```
- **Capture**: Videos, screenshots, trace and others are captured automatically on test failures.  
  **Steps to view the trace**:
  1. Once the tests finish running, open the generated HTML report.
  2. **Navigate to the Failed Test**: In the HTML report, you’ll see a list of test results. Look for the test that failed and was retried.
  3. **Click on the Retry #1 Tab**: This tab will display details specific to the retried run of the test.
  4. **View the Trace**: Once inside the '**Retry #1**' tab, under the "**Traces**" section, you will see an "**Image**" that you need to click on.
  5. **Explore the trace**: Once the trace viewer opens, you can inspect the steps of the test('**Actions**' tab), view screenshots, details('**Metadata**' tab) network activity, and console logs.
- **Environment Management**: Use environment files to easily run tests across different environments. Set in `.env` file. E.g: `ENV='test'`  
   **Enviroments examples**:
  - test
  - staging
  - production
- **Execute Test Filtering Using Tags**: You can tag tests (e.g., @Regression, @Smoke, @Negative) and selectively execute only the required.  
   **Tags examples**:

  - @Regression
  - @Smoke
  - @Acceptance
  - @Functional
  - @E2E
  - @Negative
  - @Boundary

  Run tests tagged with a single tag, such as @Regression:

  ```bash
  npx playwright test --grep '@Regression' --project=chromium --headed
  ```

  Run tests tagged with either @Regression or @Smoke:

  ```bash
  npx playwright test --grep '@Regression|@Smoke' --project=chromium --headed
  ```

  Run tests that have both @Regression and @Smoke tags:

  ```bash
  npx playwright test --grep '@Regression' --grep '@Smoke' --project=chromium --headed
  ```

- **Slow Motion Execution for Debugging**: This feature allows developers to slow down the execution of automated tests.

  - Helps debug flaky or timing-sensitive tests.
  - Makes it easier to observe and review step-by-step behavior of the tests.
  - Reduces the likelihood of missing UI bugs that might be invisible during normal test execution.

  Running tests in slow motion mode(**--project=chromium-slow**):

  ```bash
  npx playwright test --grep '@TC-0001' --project=chromium-slow --headed
  ```

- **Inspector Mode for Debugging**: This feature allows developers to pause test execution and interactively debug tests using **Playwright's Inspector**.

  - **Step-by-step debugging**: Pause and inspect the test at any point, interact with the page, and review actions in real-time.
  - **Ideal for troubleshooting**: Helps identify issues, verify selectors, and debug flaky or timing-sensitive tests.
  - **Script generation**: Record interactions to automatically generate Playwright test code.

  Using the `--debug` flag enables this mode, making test debugging more efficient and improving test reliability.

  ```bash
  npx playwright test --grep '@TC-0001' --project=chromium --headed --debug
  ```

- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Implemented for better test structure and maintainability.
- **Logger**: Utilizes the winston library to manage logging during test execution.
- **Headed/Headless Mode**: Supports both headed and headless execution for Firefox and Chrome browsers.
- **Allure Reports**: Automatically generated after test execution for clear reporting.
  ```bash
  npm run test:ui:allure
  ```

  </div>

## :robot: GitHub Actions:

- **Automated Execution**: Tests run automatically on every push to the main branch or when a pull request is created.
- **Scheduled Regression Tests**: Schedule a daily regression test at 22:00 PM and deploy the Allure report.  
  [https://ovidiocbba.github.io/playwright-typescript-project](https://ovidiocbba.github.io/playwright-typescript-project)

- **Manual Execution**: Trigger test cases manually with different parameters.
  [/actions/workflows/execution.yml](https://github.com/ovidiocbba/playwright-typescript-project/actions/workflows/execution.yml)

- **Secure Secrets Management**: Use GitHub Secrets to handle sensitive data securely.  
  **Secrets**: SONAR_TOKEN, UI_PASSWORD, UI_PASSWORD
- **Composite Action**: Leverage a custom composite action for deploying Allure reports.  
  [/.github/actions/deploy_allure_report/action.yml](https://github.com/ovidiocbba/playwright-typescript-project/blob/main/.github/actions/deploy_allure_report/action.yml)

- **GitHub Action Reporter**: Integration with GitHub Action reporter to display test results directly in GitHub.
- **SonarQube Integration**: Analyze code for vulnerabilities and code smells using SonarQubeCloud integration.  
  [https://sonarcloud.io/project/issues?id=ovidiocbba_playwright-typescript-project](https://sonarcloud.io/project/issues?issueStatuses=OPEN%2CCONFIRMED&id=ovidiocbba_playwright-typescript-project)
- **Allure Report Deployment**: Automatically deploy Allure reports using GitHub Pages for easy access and sharing.
